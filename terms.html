  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 5, 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms govern your use of the GoRoam apps and services (“<strong>GoRoam</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”). By using GoRoam you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use GoRoam. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must have your parent/guardian’s consent.</p>

  <h2>Your Account</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and device.</li>
    <li>You must provide accurate information and comply with applicable laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User Content & Conduct</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You retain ownership of content you submit (e.g., reviews, photos). You grant GoRoam a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, modify, and display your content for operating and improving the service.</li>
    <li>Do not post illegal, infringing, hateful, harassing, deceptive, or unsafe content. Do not spam or attempt to manipulate ratings.</li>
    <li>We may remove content or suspend accounts that violate these Terms or our guidelines.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>GoRoam uses third-party services (e.g., Google Maps/Places, Firebase). These services may have their own terms and policies.</p>

  <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>GoRoam is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”. We do not guarantee accuracy of place data or uninterrupted operation.</p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, GoRoam and its affiliates will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill.</p>

  <h2>Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or for safety, legal, or operational reasons. You may stop using GoRoam at any time; you can request account deletion via in-app controls (if available) or by contacting support.</p>

  <h2>Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your principal place of business (specify). Any disputes will be resolved in the courts located there, unless local law requires otherwise. You and GoRoam may also agree to arbitration where applicable.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms; continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
