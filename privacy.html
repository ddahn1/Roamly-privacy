  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 5, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how GoRoam (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the GoRoam mobile and web apps (“<strong>App</strong>”). By using the App, you agree to this Policy.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data:</strong> email, display name/username, Firebase UID, profile photo.</li>
    <li><strong>Content you provide:</strong> reviews, ratings, photos, comments.</li>
    <li><strong>Location data:</strong> approximate location (to power place search and local features). You can disable device location in your OS settings; core features may be limited.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & device data:</strong> IP address, device identifiers, app version, OS, pages/actions, timestamps, crash logs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate your account and provide core features (favorites, reviews, media uploads).</li>
    <li>Find nearby places and personalize results (using location).</li>
    <li>Keep the service reliable and secure (analytics, crash reporting, abuse prevention).</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about important changes, support, or service updates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We share data with trusted vendors that help us operate the App. Their handling of data is governed by their own policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase (Auth, Storage, Crashlytics)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google (Maps/Places APIs)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access/Download/Deletion:</strong> You may request a copy or deletion of your account data by emailing <a href="mailto:support@GoRoamapp.com">support@GoRoamapp.com</a>. If the App includes an in-app “Delete Account” action, using it will permanently remove your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out of marketing:</strong> Use the unsubscribe link in emails or email us.</li>
    <li><strong>California & EU/UK residents:</strong> Subject to local law, you may have rights to access, delete, correct, or restrict processing of your personal data and to object or withdraw consent where applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain account data while your account is active and as needed for legal/compliance, security, and backup. User content (e.g., reviews) may be anonymized when accounts are deleted if required for platform integrity and anti-abuse.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>GoRoam is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will take appropriate action.</p>
